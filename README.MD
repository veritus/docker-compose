# Docker compose for Veritus

This repository contains the docker-compose file that expresses our whole stack.

Its required to install docker-compose first (here)[https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/] before starting

Currently this only works for the backend.

## Start backend
Run the following in the root directory of this project
```
$ docker-compose up 
```

Go to localhost:8000 and you should see the API routes
